      <p class="lead-color left-align">What is Korean American Family Service Center?&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Korean American Family Service Center (KAFSC)</b> is a non-profit organization that commits to prevent domestic violence, sexual assault, and relationship abuse by providing services to individuals and families in the Tri-State Area. Services that they provide are counseling, education, and advocacy programs, which are heavily dependent on donations and grants such as VAWA.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lead mts mbm">
      <p class="lead-color">What is VAWA?&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)</b> is a landmark piece of legislation that seeks to improve criminal justice and community-based responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in the United States. VAWA currently administers 25 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/grant-programs" target="_blank">grant programs</a> that funnel money to programs “designed to develop the nation’s capacity to reduce domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking by strengthening services to victims and holding offenders accountable.” Unfortunately, based on a new report, VAWA could be on the budgetary chopping block under Donald Trump’s administration.</p>

    <div class="lead mts mbm">
      <p class="lead-color">How is KAFSC affected by this budget cut?&nbsp;</p>
      <p>KAFSC is one of many non-profit organizations that rely on VAWA grant funds to serve victims of domestic violence. Currently, VAWA provides funding for transitional housing and employment services, counseling of hundreds of victims and survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and over 40% of the 1200+ bed nights provided by our emergency shelter services at KAFSC. Cumulatively, this represents almost <b>20% of KAFSC’s program operations budget</b>.</p>
